1. Create a new directory/folder inside the “TerminalTwo” folder called “TerminalExercise”
2. Inside “TerminalExercise” create a new directory/folder called “Marvel”
3. Inside “Marvel” add 2 directories/folders: “Avengers” and “Villains”
4. Inside “Avengers” create these files: “captainAmerica.txt”, “blackWidow.txt”, “ironMan.txt, and “happy.txt”
5. Create a new directory/folder inside “Avengers” called “MoreAvengers”
6. Inside “MoreAvengers” create these files: “falcon.txt”, “doctorStrange.txt”, and “blackPanther.txt”
7. Get to the “Villains” directory/folder and create these files: “thanos.txt”, “ultron.txt”, “redSkull.txt” inside of it
8. You decide Happy is not actually an Avenger. Remove the “happy.txt” file.
9. Uh oh, Thanos snapped his fingers and now Falcon, Doctor Strange, and Black Panther are gone! Delete the “MoreAvengers” directory/folder.
BONUS:
Create a new folder inside of the “TerminalTwo” folder called “TerminalExerciseBonus” instead of “TerminalExercise”.
Next move into the “TerminalExerciseBonus” folder and try to complete 2 through 9 again WITHOUT using the cd command (AKA Without moving out of the “TerminalExerciseBonus” folder/directory) (edited)
